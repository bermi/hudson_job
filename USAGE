Description:
    Creates a Hudson Job folder you can drag and drop to your $HUDSON_HOME
    in order to have Continuous Integration built into your application.
    
    This generator uses git as SCM and supports github accounts. If you
    would like to add support for other SCM please fork 
    
        http://github.com/bermi/hudson_generator
    
    This generator just creates the basics so you can use hudsons web 
    interface to fine tune the default settings.
        
    To get quick notifications on build status I recommend 
        - CCMenu on Mac
        - CCTray for Windows
        - JCCTray on others

Example:
    `./makelos generate hudson_job husdon`

    Where hudson is the path you want to store your Hudson CI settings.
    The generator will prompt for more details.
